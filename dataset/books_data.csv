69IyAgAAQBAJ,python,"Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, revised and expanded edition",N/A,John V. Guttag,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

ZeDmDQAAQBAJ,python,Programming with Python,N/A,T R Padmanabhan,"Based on the latest version of the language, this book offers a self-contained, concise and coherent introduction to programming with Python. The book’s primary focus is on realistic case study applications of Python. Each practical example is accompanied by a brief explanation of the problem-terminology and concepts, followed by necessary program development in Python using its constructs, and simulated testing. Given the open and participatory nature of development, Python has a variety of incorporated data structures, which has made it difficult to present it in a coherent manner. Further, some advanced concepts (super, yield, generator, decorator, etc.) are not easy to explain. The book specially addresses these challenges; starting with a minimal subset of the core, it offers users a step-by-step guide to achieving proficiency.",ISBN_13: 9789811032776; ISBN_10: 9811032777,True,True,349,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZeDmDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZeDmDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,9239.4,INR,9239.4,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZeDmDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZeDmDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2017,Springer

Python has made great strides since Apress released the first edition of this book back in the days of Python 2.3. The advances required new chapters to be written from the ground up, and others to be extensively revised. You will learn fundamentals like IP, TCP, DNS and SSL by using working Python programs; you will also be able to familiarize yourself with infrastructure components like memcached and message queues. You can also delve into network server designs, and compare threaded approaches with asynchronous event-based solutions. But the biggest change is this edition's expanded treatment of the web. The HTTP protocol is covered in extensive detail, with each feature accompanied by sample Python code. You can use your HTTP protocol expertise by studying an entire chapter on screen scraping and you can then test lxml and BeautifulSoup against a real-world web site. The chapter on web application programming now covers both the WSGI standard for component interoperability, as well as modern web frameworks like Django. Finally, all of the old favorites from the first edition are back: E-mail protocols like SMTP, POP, and IMAP get full treatment, as does XML-RPC. You can still learn how to code Python network programs using the Telnet and FTP protocols, but you are likely to appreciate the power of more modern alternatives like the paramiko SSH2 library.

m-AavgAACAAJ,python,HT THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIEN,N/A,"Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, Chris Meyers","The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, The way of the program. On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end.

gdN5AAAAQBAJ,python,Python in Practice,"Create Better Programs Using Concurrency, Libraries, and Patterns",Mark Summerfield,"Winner of the 2014 Jolt Award for ""Best Book"" “Whether you are an experienced programmer or are starting your career, Python in Practice is full of valuable advice and example to help you improve your craft by thinking about problems from different perspectives, introducing tools, and detailing techniques to create more effective solutions.” —Doug Hellmann, Senior Developer, DreamHost If you’re an experienced Python programmer, Python in Practice will help you improve the quality, reliability, speed, maintainability, and usability of all your Python programs. Mark Summerfield focuses on four key themes: design patterns for coding elegance, faster processing through concurrency and compiled Python (Cython), high-level networking, and graphics. He identifies well-proven design patterns that are useful in Python, illuminates them with expert-quality code, and explains why some object-oriented design patterns are irrelevant to Python. He also explodes several counterproductive myths about Python programming—showing, for example, how Python can take full advantage of multicore hardware. All examples, including three complete case studies, have been tested with Python 3.3 (and, where possible, Python 3.2 and 3.1) and crafted to maintain compatibility with future Python 3.x versions. All code has been tested on Linux, and most code has also been tested on OS X and Windows. All code may be downloaded at www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html. Coverage includes Leveraging Python’s most effective creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns Supporting concurrency with Python’s multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures modules Avoiding concurrency problems using thread-safe queues and futures rather than fragile locks Simplifying networking with high-level modules, including xmlrpclib and RPyC Accelerating Python code with Cython, C-based Python modules, profiling, and other techniques Creating modern-looking GUI applications with Tkinter Leveraging today’s powerful graphics hardware via the OpenGL API using pyglet and PyOpenGL",ISBN_13: 9780133373233; ISBN_10: 0133373231,True,True,326,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gdN5AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gdN5AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1,5.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2198.67,INR,2198.67,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gdN5AAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gdN5AAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013,Addison-Wesley

vr05swEACAAJ,python,A Byte of Python,"""A Byte of Python"" Is a Free Book on Programming Using the Python Language. If All You Know about Computers Is How to Save Text Files, Then This Is the Book for You.","C. H. C H Swaroop, James Zimmerhoff","The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC (programming language) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[6] Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[7] Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[8] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.[9] In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[10] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as ""one of Python's major programming units.""[1] Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.[1] Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that ""Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches.""[11] The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions. By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp's keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.[12] During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic ""literacy"" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.[14] Here are what people are saying about the book: This is the best beginner's tutorial I've ever seen! Thank you for your effort. -- Walt Michalik The best thing i found was ""A Byte of Python,"" which is simply a brilliant book for a beginner.

OyYuEAAAQBAJ,python,Probabilistic Machine Learning,An Introduction,Kevin P. Murphy,"A detailed and up-to-date introduction to machine learning, presented through the unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory. This book offers a detailed and up-to-date introduction to machine learning (including deep learning) through the unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory. The book covers mathematical background (including linear algebra and optimization), basic supervised learning (including linear and logistic regression and deep neural networks), as well as more advanced topics (including transfer learning and unsupervised learning). End-of-chapter exercises allow students to apply what they have learned, and an appendix covers notation. Probabilistic Machine Learning grew out of the author’s 2012 book, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective. More than just a simple update, this is a completely new book that reflects the dramatic developments in the field since 2012, most notably deep learning. In addition, the new book is accompanied by online Python code, using libraries such as scikit-learn, JAX, PyTorch, and Tensorflow, which can be used to reproduce nearly all the figures; this code can be run inside a web browser using cloud-based notebooks, and provides a practical complement to the theoretical topics discussed in the book. This introductory text will be followed by a sequel that covers more advanced topics, taking the same probabilistic approach.",ISBN_13: 9780262369305; ISBN_10: 0262369303,True,True,858,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OyYuEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OyYuEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,7667.64,INR,7667.64,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OyYuEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-OyYuEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022,MIT Press

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules. The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advance level. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modules like collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The ""e;time""e; chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things. The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interaction with OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view. In order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes. What will you learnPython for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters.

Uw3ZzQEACAAJ,python,Learn Python Programming for Beginners,The Complete Guide To Learn Coding with Python. Become Fluent in This High-Level Programming Language,Jason Scratch,"Are you interested in Python? If yes, then this is the right book for you! Python was created in 1990 by Guido van Rossu, and is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It has become extremely popular over the past decade, thanks to its intuitive nature, flexibility, and versatility. Python can be used on a wide variety of operating systems, and its clean, readable code style makes it relatively beginner-friendly, while not as fast as other languages, such as C++ or JAVA, Python code is often much shorter and simpler than other languages. Python also supports several packages and modules created by other developers to make the development of Python applications quicker and easier. There are hundreds of different programming languages out there in the world, with Wikipedia listing over 700 notable languages. Given how many languages you could potentially learn, why learn Python? Python has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years, driven by several aspects that make it an incredibly versatile and intuitive language. A huge selling point of Python is the cleanliness and readability of its syntax and structure. Commands in Python can often be carried out using simple English keywords, which makes the language much more intuitive than many other languages. Python is also quite versatile in the sense that it supports both structured programming and object-oriented programming approaches. Python even allows the use of certain aspects of functional programming. This Book Covers: Understanding Python Why the name ""Python""? Python Glossary Python Installation Python Data Types And much more!! Despite its simplicity, Python is also sturdy and robust enough to carry out complex scientific and mathematical tasks.

gA9QDwAAQBAJ,python,The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference,N/A,Terence Parr,"Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

HTozEAAAQBAJ,python,IronPython in Action,N/A,"Christian J. Muirhead, Michael Foord","In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework. IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more.

What You Will Learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface Extend class functionality using inheritance Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3 Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django. Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio In Detail Python 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax. Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software. You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program. You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy. This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.

iNfPEAAAQBAJ,python,Code,The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,Charles Petzold,"The classic guide to how computers work, updated with new chapters and interactive graphics ""For me, Code was a revelation. It was the first book about programming that spoke to me. It started with a story, and it built up, layer by layer, analogy by analogy, until I understood not just the Code, but the System. Code is a book that is as much about Systems Thinking and abstractions as it is about code and programming. Code teaches us how many unseen layers there are between the computer systems that we as users look at every day and the magical silicon rocks that we infused with lightning and taught to think."" - Scott Hanselman, Partner Program Director, Microsoft, and host of Hanselminutes Computers are everywhere, most obviously in our laptops and smartphones, but also our cars, televisions, microwave ovens, alarm clocks, robot vacuum cleaners, and other smart appliances. Have you ever wondered what goes on inside these devices to make our lives easier but occasionally more infuriating? For more than 20 years, readers have delighted in Charles Petzold's illuminating story of the secret inner life of computers, and now he has revised it for this new age of computing. Cleverly illustrated and easy to understand, this is the book that cracks the mystery. You'll discover what flashlights, black cats, seesaws, and the ride of Paul Revere can teach you about computing, and how human ingenuity and our compulsion to communicate have shaped every electronic device we use. This new expanded edition explores more deeply the bit-by-bit and gate-by-gate construction of the heart of every smart device, the central processing unit that combines the simplest of basic operations to perform the most complex of feats.

Srinivasa Varadharajan","Optics is an enabling science that forms a basis for our technological civilization. Courses in optics are a required part of the engineering or physics undergraduate curriculum in many universities worldwide. The aim of Understanding Optics with Python is twofold: first, to describe certain basic ideas of classical physical and geometric optics; second, to introduce the reader to computer simulations of physical phenomena. The text is aimed more broadly for those who wish to use numerical/computational modeling as an educational tool that promotes interactive teaching (and learning). In addition, it offers an alternative to developing countries where the necessary equipment to carry out the appropriate experiments is not available as a result of financial constraints. This approach contributes to a better diffusion of knowledge about optics. The examples given in this book are comparable to those found in standard textbooks on optics and are suitable for self-study. This text enables the user to study and understand optics using hands-on simulations with Python. Python is our programming language of choice because of its open-source availability, extensive functionality, and an enormous online support. Essentials of programming in Python 3.x, including graphical user interface, are also provided. The codes in the book are available for download on the book’s website. Discusses most standard topics of traditional physical and geometrical optics through Python and PyQt5 Provides visualizations and in-depth descriptions of Python’s programming language and simulations Includes simulated laboratories where students are provided a ""hands-on"" exploration of Python software Coding and programming featured within the text are available for download on the book’s corresponding website. ""Understanding Optics with Python by Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, and L. Srinivasa Varadharajan is born around a nice idea: using simulations to provide the students with a powerful tool to understand and master optical phenomena. The choice of the Python language is perfectly matched with the overall goal of the book, as the Python language provides a completely free and easy-to-learn platform with huge cross-platform compatibility, where the reader of the book can conduct his or her own numerical experiments to learn faster and better."" — Costantino De Angelis, University of Brescia, Italy ""Teaching an important programming language like Python through concrete examples from optics is a natural and, in my view, very effective approach. I believe that this book will be used by students and appreciated greatly by instructors. The topic of modelling optical effects and systems where the students should already have a physical background provides great motivation for students to learn the basics of a powerful programming language without the intimidation factor that often goes with a formal computer science course."" — John Dudley, FEMTO-ST Institute, Besançon, France",ISBN_13: 9781351648844; ISBN_10: 1351648845,True,True,342,Science,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2018,CRC Press

Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development.

19CyDgAAQBAJ,python,Deep Learning with Python,A Hands-on Introduction,Nikhil Ketkar,"Discover the practical aspects of implementing deep-learning solutions using the rich Python ecosystem. This book bridges the gap between the academic state-of-the-art and the industry state-of-the-practice by introducing you to deep learning frameworks such as Keras, Theano, and Caffe. The practicalities of these frameworks is often acquired by practitioners by reading source code, manuals, and posting questions on community forums, which tends to be a slow and a painful process. Deep Learning with Python allows you to ramp up to such practical know-how in a short period of time and focus more on the domain, models, and algorithms. This book briefly covers the mathematical prerequisites and fundamentals of deep learning, making this book a good starting point for software developers who want to get started in deep learning. A brief survey of deep learning architectures is also included. Deep Learning with Python also introduces you to key concepts of automatic differentiation and GPU computation which, while not central to deep learning, are critical when it comes to conducting large scale experiments.

gSFYYKbtDCsC,python,Monty Python's Flying Circus,"An Utterly Complete, Thoroughly Unillustrated, Absolutely Unauthorized Guide to Possibly All the References : from Arthur ""Two-Sheds"" Jackson to Zambesi",Darl Larsen,"In 1969, the BBC aired the first episode of a new comedy series titled Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the rest, as they say, is history. An instant success, the show ran until 1974, producing a total of 45 episodes. Despite the show's very English humor and allusions to many things British, the series developed a cult following outside the U.K., particularly in the United States. Known for its outrageous humor, occasionally controversial content, and often silly spirit, Monty Python's Flying Circus poked fun at nearly all institutions--domestic or foreign, grand or intimate, sacred or not. Indeed, many of the allusions and references in the program were uniquely British and routinely obscure, and therefore, not always understood or even noticed outside the British Isles. This exhaustive reference identifies and explains the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions of this landmark series. In this resource, virtually every allusion and reference that appeared in an episode--whether stated by a character, depicted in the mise-en-scene, or mentioned in the printed scripts--is identified and explained. Organized chronologically by episode, each entry is listed alphabetically, indicates what sketch it appeared in, and is cross-referenced between episodes. Entries cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places; as well as the myriad social, cultural, and historical elements (photos, songs, slogans, caricatures) that populate and inform these episodes. Entries Include: -""Arabella Plunkett"" -Group of famous characters from famous paintings -Hell's Grannies -HRH The Dummy Princess Margaret -""Kandinsky"" -""On the Dad's Liver Bachelors at Large"" -Raymond Baxter type -Scun -""Spanish Inquisition"" -""Third Parachute Brigade Amateur Dramatic Society"" -""total cashectomy"" -""Two-Sheds"" -""Umbonga's hostile opening"" -Vicar sitting thin and unhappy in a pot -""What's all this then?""",ISBN_13: 9780810861312; ISBN_10: 0810861313,False,True,576,Monty Python's flying circus (Television program),en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSFYYKbtDCsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSFYYKbtDCsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2008,Rowman & Littlefield

I just wished I could remember what actually went on then."" --Terry Jones ""If anyone can remember more about making the Life of Brian than me, it's Kim ‘Howard' Johnson. He came, he saw, he got into costume. While the rest of us were fighting to upstage each other, Howard had a notebook hidden in his toga."" --Michael Palin ""Since I've forgotten everything, it will be great to read what was actually going on in Tunisia. Just as long as I'm the most quoted, the most vital to the shooting, and the most interesting. You don't have to mention my stunning good looks if you don't want to."" --Terry Gilliam ""Of all the books that I am planning to read in my dotage, there is none I am more looking forward to than Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday. . . . Not only does ‘Howard' Johnson know more about Python than anyone outside of the IRS, he was in Tunisia for most of the filming of Life of Brian, and is the only person who captured every thoughtless remark, heated exchange, embarrassing detail, petty insult, and spiteful act of indifference."" --John Cleese ""Kim ‘Howard' Johnson was invented by Graham Chapman during an idle moment on the set of The Life of Brian. ‘Let's invent a person,' he said. ‘An American fan from the Midwest,' chimed in Michael Palin, ‘who keeps a daily diary of Python filming. And then doesn't publish it for years and years.' How we laughed, and each day we'd make up stuff this ‘person' would write about us."" --Eric Idle In 1978, Kim ""Howard"" Johnson ran away to join the circus---Monty Python's Flying Circus, that is. The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus's double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks. The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective. Even the most diehard fans will get a fresh take on the comedy greats through some never-before-revealed nuggets of Python brilliance: what John Cleese offered to exchange for suntan lotion; Terry Jones directing in drag; Michael Palin's secret to playing revolutionaries and peasants; Graham Chapman gets naked; Terry Gilliam gets filthy; Eric Idle haggles; the secret of the Thespo-Squat; Mrs. Pilate; talk of George Harrison; the cake-flinging that jeopardized the production; badminton, impromptu cricket, and erotic frescoes; and the first-ever presentation of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""

Shot in the Middle East and produced during Margaret Thatcher’s ascendant years, the film satirized—among other matters—authoritarianism and religious zealotry. Upon its release, Monty Python’s Life of Brian was both a critical and commercial success, and has been since hailed as one of the greatest comedies of all time. But the film also faced backlash from religious groups for its blasphemy, perceived or otherwise.

Based on example applications, this book introduces various kinds of testing and shows you how to set up automated systems that run these tests, and install applications in different environments in controlled ways. Python Continuous Integration and Delivery tackles the technical problems related to software development that are typically glossed over in pure programming texts. After reading this book, you’ll see that in today's fast-moving world, no software project can afford to go through development, then an integration phase of unpredictable length and complexity, and finally be shipped to the customer -- just to find out that the resulting application didn't quite fill their need. Instead, you’ll discover that practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery reduces the risks by keeping changes small and automating otherwise painful processes.

F-Q_EAAAQBAJ,python,Smart Log Data Analytics,Techniques for Advanced Security Analysis,"Florian Skopik, Markus Wurzenberger, Max Landauer","This book provides insights into smart ways of computer log data analysis, with the goal of spotting adversarial actions. It is organized into 3 major parts with a total of 8 chapters that include a detailed view on existing solutions, as well as novel techniques that go far beyond state of the art. The first part of this book motivates the entire topic and highlights major challenges, trends and design criteria for log data analysis approaches, and further surveys and compares the state of the art. The second part of this book introduces concepts that apply character-based, rather than token-based, approaches and thus work on a more fine-grained level. Furthermore, these solutions were designed for “online use”, not only forensic analysis, but also process new log lines as they arrive in an efficient single pass manner. An advanced method for time series analysis aims at detecting changes in the overall behavior profile of an observed system and spotting trends and periodicities through log analysis. The third part of this book introduces the design of the AMiner, which is an advanced open source component for log data anomaly mining. The AMiner comes with several detectors to spot new events, new parameters, new correlations, new values and unknown value combinations and can run as stand-alone solution or as sensor with connection to a SIEM solution. More advanced detectors help to determines the characteristics of variable parts of log lines, specifically the properties of numerical and categorical fields. Detailed examples throughout this book allow the reader to better understand and apply the introduced techniques with open source software. Step-by-step instructions help to get familiar with the concepts and to better comprehend their inner mechanisms. A log test data set is available as free download and enables the reader to get the system up and running in no time. This book is designed for researchers working in the field of cyber security, and specifically system monitoring, anomaly detection and intrusion detection. The content of this book will be particularly useful for advanced-level students studying computer science, computer technology, and information systems. Forward-thinking practitioners, who would benefit from becoming familiar with the advanced anomaly detection methods, will also be interested in this book.",ISBN_13: 9783030744502; ISBN_10: 3030744507,True,True,210,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,11764.6,INR,11764.6,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-F-Q_EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Springer Nature

NZP6AQAAQBAJ,python,Machine Learning,A Probabilistic Perspective,Kevin P. Murphy,"A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online.

vqTfNFDzzdIC,python,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,N/A,Martin Fowler,"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.

KXQrAQAAQBAJ,python,Head First Java,A Brain-Friendly Guide,"Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates","Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.",ISBN_13: 9781449331443; ISBN_10: 1449331440,True,True,720,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXQrAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXQrAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2,5.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2005,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc."""

It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies.

Computer languages are not inherently hard to understand, even for non-techies. Remembering is the problem. Research shows that you will remember everything if you're repeatedly asked to recall it. That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises--they're free online--that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold. The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small.

All the figures and numerical results are reproducible using the Python codes provided. The author develops key intuitions in machine learning by working meaningful examples using multiple analytical methods and Python codes, thereby connecting theoretical concepts to concrete implementations. Detailed proofs for certain important results are also provided. Modern Python modules like Pandas, Sympy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras are applied to simulate and visualize important machine learning concepts like the bias/variance trade-off, cross-validation, and regularization. Many abstract mathematical ideas, such as convergence in probability theory, are developed and illustrated with numerical examples. This updated edition now includes the Fisher Exact Test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test. A new section on survival analysis has been included as well as substantial development of Generalized Linear Models. The new deep learning section for image processing includes an in-depth discussion of gradient descent methods that underpin all deep learning algorithms. As with the prior edition, there are new and updated *Programming Tips* that the illustrate effective Python modules and methods for scientific programming and machine learning. There are 445 run-able code blocks with corresponding outputs that have been tested for accuracy. Over 158 graphical visualizations (almost all generated using Python) illustrate the concepts that are developed both in code and in mathematics.

r9x-OXdzpPcC,python,The Lean Startup,How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,Eric Ries,"Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs—in companies of all sizes—a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.",ISBN_13: 9780307887894; ISBN_10: 0307887898,False,False,337,Business & Economics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,4.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2011,Crown Currency

XxnZrQEACAAJ,python,R for Marketing Research and Analytics,N/A,"Chris Chapman, Elea McDonnell Feit","This book is a complete introduction to the power of R for marketing research practitioners. The text describes statistical models from a conceptual point of view with a minimal amount of mathematics, presuming only an introductory knowledge of statistics. Hands-on chapters accelerate the learning curve by asking readers to interact with R from the beginning. Core topics include the R language, basic statistics, linear modeling, and data visualization, which is presented throughout as an integral part of analysis. Later chapters cover more advanced topics yet are intended to be approachable for all analysts. These sections examine logistic regression, customer segmentation, hierarchical linear modeling, market basket analysis, structural equation modeling, and conjoint analysis in R. The text uniquely presents Bayesian models with a minimally complex approach, demonstrating and explaining Bayesian methods alongside traditional analyses for analysis of variance, linear models, and metric and choice-based conjoint analysis. With its emphasis on data visualization, model assessment, and development of statistical intuition, this book provides guidance for any analyst looking to develop or improve skills in R for marketing applications.",ISBN_10: 3319144359; ISBN_13: 9783319144351,False,False,0,Business & Economics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxnZrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxnZrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2015,Springer

l3aYDwAAQBAJ,python,Python For Learners,N/A,Ajit Singh,"This text is an introduction to the world of the python. This book encapsulates rich practical hands-on experience in developing python based applications, combined with teaching the subject for graduate/post-graduate students. The book is therefore a culmination of putting together what has been both practiced as well as preached, which is the one of the most compelling differentiators for this book. It can also be used for independent study by anyone interested in getting a broad introduction to a core useful set of the python language. Python For Learners provides all essential programming concepts and information one shall need in order to start developing their own Python program. The book provides a comprehensive walk-through of Python programming in a clear, straightforward manner that beginners will appreciate. Important concepts are introduced through a step-by-step discussion and reinforced by relevant examples and illustrations. This book can be used as a guide to help explore, harness, and gain appreciation of the capabilities and features of Python. My approach in this book is to regard python as a language that readers will want to use as a primary tool in many different areas of their programming work - not just for creating programs with graphical content. Nevertheless, i recognize that visual examples are much more fun to create and work with. This book is a close-to-complete presentation of the Python language. It is oriented toward learning, which involves accumulating many closely intertwined concepts. In our experience teaching, coaching and doing programming, there is an upper limit on the clue absorption rate. In order to keep within this limit, i have found that it helps to present a language as ever-expanding layers. Well lead you from a very tiny, easy to understand subset of statements to the entire Python language and all of the built-in data structures. ● Ajit Singh",,False,True,240,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3aYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3aYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,185.0,INR,129.5,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l3aYDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-l3aYDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Ajit Singh

Wws0AAAAMAAJ,python,Pretending and Meaning,Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse,Richard Henry,"Since Plato, Western critics of literature have asked how it is possible for fiction writers to mean something serious. The outrage over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, highlighted our continued uneasiness over distinctions between fact and fiction, novel and history, truth and falsehood. The blasphemy charged against Rushdie raises important questions: Did Rushdie mean The Satanic Verses, or didn't he? When he publicly recanted, what did he mean? What do we even mean by mean? This is the starting point for Richard Henry's fascinating investigation of the pragmatic foundations of fictional discourse. Drawing from Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature, Henry offers a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts. Pretending and Meaning: Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse draws upon Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature to offer a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts.",OTHER: UOM:39015037768341,False,False,152,History,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,1996,Praeger

gpB6DQAAQBAJ,python,Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives,A Python-based Guide,Yves Hilpisch,"Leverage Python for expert-level volatility and variance derivative trading Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of these increasingly popular derivatives products, and has the distinction of being both the first to cover European volatility and variance products provided by Eurex and the first to offer Python code for implementing comprehensive quantitative analyses of these financial products. For those who want to get started right away, the book is accompanied by a dedicated Web page and a Github repository that includes all the code from the book for easy replication and use, as well as a hosted version of all the code for immediate execution. Python is fast making inroads into financial modelling and derivatives analytics, and recent developments allow Python to be as fast as pure C++ or C while consisting generally of only 10% of the code lines associated with the compiled languages. This complete guide offers rare insight into the use of Python to undertake complex quantitative analyses of listed volatility and variance derivatives. Learn how to use Python for data and financial analysis, and reproduce stylised facts on volatility and variance markets Gain an understanding of the fundamental techniques of modelling volatility and variance and the model-free replication of variance Familiarise yourself with micro structure elements of the markets for listed volatility and variance derivatives Reproduce all results and graphics with IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and Python codes that accompany the book Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is the complete guide to Python-based quantitative analysis of these Eurex derivatives products.",ISBN_13: 9781119167938; ISBN_10: 1119167930,True,True,398,Business & Economics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,10509.08,INR,10509.08,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,John Wiley & Sons

ZwbgAAAAMAAJ,python,"Snakes in Myth, Magic, and History",The Story of a Human Obsession,Diane Morgan,"The snake is one of humankind's most powerful and ambiguous symbols: it has at various times represented immortality and death, male and female, deity and demon, circle and line, killer and healer, the highest wisdom and the deepest subconscious. By virtue of its mysterious movement, potent poison, fearful grip, unblinking gaze and lightning quick strike, the power and image of the snake has wound its way into every culture. Whether snakes are worshipped as gods, feared as devils, or handled in religious ceremonies to test faith, snakes have played a critical role in the human heritage. This book explores the cult of the snake in world history, religion, and folklore. Fascination with snakes has been around since the dawn of time. Even today, images of snakes attract attention, fear, disgust, or admiration. Morgan examines that obsession with this mysterious creature, covering in vivid details such topics as mythical snakes like the Plumed Serpent, serpent iconography, tall tales, as well as the psychological symbolism that has attached itself to snakes. Cultures as diverse as pre-Columbian America, India, Egypt, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Celtic Europe, and the United States have all accorded the serpent a special place in their culture—apparently regardless of whether or not real snakes play an important part in the life of the people. Here, the mysterious nature of the snake unfolds, enchanting readers with a colorful and lively discussion of its place in our history, stories, religions, and cultures.",OTHER: IND:30000122490406,False,False,216,Literary Criticism,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZwbgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZwbgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2008,Praeger

gpB6DQAAQBAJ,python,Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives,A Python-based Guide,Yves Hilpisch,"Leverage Python for expert-level volatility and variance derivative trading Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of these increasingly popular derivatives products, and has the distinction of being both the first to cover European volatility and variance products provided by Eurex and the first to offer Python code for implementing comprehensive quantitative analyses of these financial products. For those who want to get started right away, the book is accompanied by a dedicated Web page and a Github repository that includes all the code from the book for easy replication and use, as well as a hosted version of all the code for immediate execution. Python is fast making inroads into financial modelling and derivatives analytics, and recent developments allow Python to be as fast as pure C++ or C while consisting generally of only 10% of the code lines associated with the compiled languages. This complete guide offers rare insight into the use of Python to undertake complex quantitative analyses of listed volatility and variance derivatives. Learn how to use Python for data and financial analysis, and reproduce stylised facts on volatility and variance markets Gain an understanding of the fundamental techniques of modelling volatility and variance and the model-free replication of variance Familiarise yourself with micro structure elements of the markets for listed volatility and variance derivatives Reproduce all results and graphics with IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and Python codes that accompany the book Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is the complete guide to Python-based quantitative analysis of these Eurex derivatives products.",ISBN_13: 9781119167938; ISBN_10: 1119167930,True,True,398,Business & Economics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,10509.08,INR,10509.08,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,John Wiley & Sons

Rather than click through page after endless page, why not let bots do the work for you? Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers will show you how to create simple programs with PHP/CURL to mine, parse, and archive online data to help you make informed decisions. Michael Schrenk, a highly regarded webbot developer, teaches you how to develop fault-tolerant designs, how best to launch and schedule the work of your bots, and how to create Internet agents that: –Send email or SMS notifications to alert you to new information quickly –Search different data sources and combine the results on one page, making the data easier to interpret and analyze –Automate purchases, auction bids, and other online activities to save time Sample projects for automating tasks like price monitoring and news aggregation will show you how to put the concepts you learn into practice. This second edition of Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers includes tricks for dealing with sites that are resistant to crawling and scraping, writing stealthy webbots that mimic human search behavior, and using regular expressions to harvest specific data. As you discover the possibilities of web scraping, you'll see how webbots can save you precious time and give you much greater control over the data available on the Web.",ISBN_13: 9781593274320; ISBN_10: 1593274327,True,True,396,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZX7xOIhG78C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZX7xOIhG78C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1959.98,INR,1959.98,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZX7xOIhG78C&rdid=book-yZX7xOIhG78C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012,No Starch Press

X5DZDwAAQBAJ,python,Effective C,An Introduction to Professional C Programming,Robert C. Seacord,"A detailed introduction to the C programming language for experienced programmers. The world runs on code written in the C programming language, yet most schools begin the curriculum with Python or Java. Effective C bridges this gap and brings C into the modern era--covering the modern C17 Standard as well as potential C2x features. With the aid of this instant classic, you'll soon be writing professional, portable, and secure C programs to power robust systems and solve real-world problems. Robert C. Seacord introduces C and the C Standard Library while addressing best practices, common errors, and open debates in the C community. Developed together with other C Standards committee experts, Effective C will teach you how to debug, test, and analyze C programs. You'll benefit from Seacord's concise explanations of C language constructs and behaviors, and from his 40 years of coding experience. You'll learn: How to identify and handle undefined behavior in a C program The range and representations of integers and floating-point values How dynamic memory allocation works and how to use nonstandard functions How to use character encodings and types How to perform I/O with terminals and filesystems using C Standard streams and POSIX file descriptors How to understand the C compiler's translation phases and the role of the preprocessor How to test, debug, and analyze C programs Effective C will teach you how to write professional, secure, and portable C code that will stand the test of time and help strengthen the foundation of the computing world.",ISBN_13: 9781718501058; ISBN_10: 1718501056,True,False,273,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X5DZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X5DZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2453.22,INR,2453.22,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5DZDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-X5DZDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020,No Starch Press

Irizarry,"Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts.

mGZUEAAAQBAJ,datascience,Data Science,"Time Complexity, Inferential Uncertainty, and Spacekime Analytics","Ivo D. Dinov, Milen Velchev Velev","The amount of new information is constantly increasing, faster than our ability to fully interpret and utilize it to improve human experiences. Addressing this asymmetry requires novel and revolutionary scientific methods and effective human and artificial intelligence interfaces. By lifting the concept of time from a positive real number to a 2D complex time (kime), this book uncovers a connection between artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and quantum mechanics. It proposes a new mathematical foundation for data science based on raising the 4D spacetime to a higher dimension where longitudinal data (e.g., time-series) are represented as manifolds (e.g., kime-surfaces). This new framework enables the development of innovative data science analytical methods for model-based and model-free scientific inference, derived computed phenotyping, and statistical forecasting. The book provides a transdisciplinary bridge and a pragmatic mechanism to translate quantum mechanical principles, such as particles and wavefunctions, into data science concepts, such as datum and inference-functions. It includes many open mathematical problems that still need to be solved, technological challenges that need to be tackled, and computational statistics algorithms that have to be fully developed and validated. Spacekime analytics provide mechanisms to effectively handle, process, and interpret large, heterogeneous, and continuously-tracked digital information from multiple sources. The authors propose computational methods, probability model-based techniques, and analytical strategies to estimate, approximate, or simulate the complex time phases (kime directions). This allows transforming time-varying data, such as time-series observations, into higher-dimensional manifolds representing complex-valued and kime-indexed surfaces (kime-surfaces). The book includes many illustrations of model-based and model-free spacekime analytic techniques applied to economic forecasting, identification of functional brain activation, and high-dimensional cohort phenotyping. Specific case-study examples include unsupervised clustering using the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI), model-based inference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-free inference using the UK Biobank data archive. The material includes mathematical, inferential, computational, and philosophical topics such as Heisenberg uncertainty principle and alternative approaches to large sample theory, where a few spacetime observations can be amplified by a series of derived, estimated, or simulated kime-phases. The authors extend Newton-Leibniz calculus of integration and differentiation to the spacekime manifold and discuss possible solutions to some of the ""problems of time"". The coverage also includes 5D spacekime formulations of classical 4D spacetime mathematical equations describing natural laws of physics, as well as, statistical articulation of spacekime analytics in a Bayesian inference framework. The steady increase of the volume and complexity of observed and recorded digital information drives the urgent need to develop novel data analytical strategies. Spacekime analytics represents one new data-analytic approach, which provides a mechanism to understand compound phenomena that are observed as multiplex longitudinal processes and computationally tracked by proxy measures. This book may be of interest to academic scholars, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, artificial intelligence and machine learning engineers, biostatisticians, econometricians, and data analysts. Some of the material may also resonate with philosophers, futurists, astrophysicists, space industry technicians, biomedical researchers, health practitioners, and the general public.",ISBN_13: 9783110697827; ISBN_10: 3110697823,False,True,490,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mGZUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mGZUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,9945.06,INR,9945.06,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mGZUEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mGZUEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG

CxE8EAAAQBAJ,datascience,Data Science and Data Analytics,Opportunities and Challenges,Amit Kumar Tyagi,"Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured (labeled) and unstructured (unlabeled) data. It is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a necessity of the future to make things easier and more productive. In simple terms, data science is the discovery of data or uncovering hidden patterns (such as complex behaviors, trends, and inferences) from data. Moreover, Big Data analytics/data analytics are the analysis mechanisms used in data science by data scientists. Several tools, such as Hadoop, R, etc., are used to analyze this large amount of data to predict valuable information and for decision-making. Note that structured data can be easily analyzed by efficient (available) business intelligence tools, while most of the data (80% of data by 2020) is in an unstructured form that requires advanced analytics tools. But while analyzing this data, we face several concerns, such as complexity, scalability, privacy leaks, and trust issues. Data science helps us to extract meaningful information or insights from unstructured or complex or large amounts of data (available or stored virtually in the cloud). Data Science and Data Analytics: Opportunities and Challenges covers all possible areas, applications with arising serious concerns, and challenges in this emerging field in detail with a comparative analysis/taxonomy. FEATURES Gives the concept of data science, tools, and algorithms that exist for many useful applications Provides many challenges and opportunities in data science and data analytics that help researchers to identify research gaps or problems Identifies many areas and uses of data science in the smart era Applies data science to agriculture, healthcare, graph mining, education, security, etc. Academicians, data scientists, and stockbrokers from industry/business will find this book useful for designing optimal strategies to enhance their firm’s productivity.",ISBN_13: 9781000423198; ISBN_10: 1000423190,False,True,483,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CxE8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CxE8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,5043.32,INR,5043.32,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CxE8EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-CxE8EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021,CRC Press

It is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a necessity of the future to make things easier and more productive. In simple terms, data science is the discovery of data or uncovering hidden patterns (such as complex behaviors, trends, and inferences) from data. Moreover, Big Data analytics/data analytics are the analysis mechanisms used in data science by data scientists. Several tools, such as Hadoop, R, etc., are used to analyze this large amount of data to predict valuable information and for decision-making. Note that structured data can be easily analyzed by efficient (available) business intelligence tools, while most of the data (80% of data by 2020) is in an unstructured form that requires advanced analytics tools. But while analyzing this data, we face several concerns, such as complexity, scalability, privacy leaks, and trust issues. Data science helps us to extract meaningful information or insights from unstructured or complex or large amounts of data (available or stored virtually in the cloud).

JmydDwAAQBAJ,datascience,Applied Data Science,Lessons Learned for the Data-Driven Business,"Martin Braschler, Thilo Stadelmann, Kurt Stockinger","This book has two main goals: to define data science through the work of data scientists and their results, namely data products, while simultaneously providing the reader with relevant lessons learned from applied data science projects at the intersection of academia and industry. As such, it is not a replacement for a classical textbook (i.e., it does not elaborate on fundamentals of methods and principles described elsewhere), but systematically highlights the connection between theory, on the one hand, and its application in specific use cases, on the other. With these goals in mind, the book is divided into three parts: Part I pays tribute to the interdisciplinary nature of data science and provides a common understanding of data science terminology for readers with different backgrounds. These six chapters are geared towards drawing a consistent picture of data science and were predominantly written by the editors themselves. Part II then broadens the spectrum by presenting views and insights from diverse authors – some from academia and some from industry, ranging from financial to health and from manufacturing to e-commerce. Each of these chapters describes a fundamental principle, method or tool in data science by analyzing specific use cases and drawing concrete conclusions from them. The case studies presented, and the methods and tools applied, represent the nuts and bolts of data science. Finally, Part III was again written from the perspective of the editors and summarizes the lessons learned that have been distilled from the case studies in Part II. The section can be viewed as a meta-study on data science across a broad range of domains, viewpoints and fields. Moreover, it provides answers to the question of what the mission-critical factors for success in different data science undertakings are. The book targets professionals as well as students of data science: first, practicing data scientists in industry and academia who want to broaden their scope and expand their knowledge by drawing on the authors’ combined experience. Second, decision makers in businesses who face the challenge of creating or implementing a data-driven strategy and who want to learn from success stories spanning a range of industries. Third, students of data science who want to understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of data science, vetted by real-world case studies at the intersection of academia and industry.",ISBN_13: 9783030118211; ISBN_10: 3030118215,False,True,464,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JmydDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JmydDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,12626.0,INR,12626.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JmydDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-JmydDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Springer

Human-centered data science is a new interdisciplinary field that draws from human-computer interaction, social science, statistics, and computational techniques. This book, written by founders of the field, introduces best practices for addressing the bias and inequality that may result from the automated collection, analysis, and distribution of very large datasets. It offers a brief and accessible overview of many common statistical and algorithmic data science techniques, explains human-centered approaches to data science problems, and presents practical guidelines and real-world case studies to help readers apply these methods. The authors explain how data scientists’ choices are involved at every stage of the data science workflow—and show how a human-centered approach can enhance each one, by making the process more transparent, asking questions, and considering the social context of the data. They describe how tools from social science might be incorporated into data science practices, discuss different types of collaboration, and consider data storytelling through visualization. The book shows that data science practitioners can build rigorous and ethical algorithms and design projects that use cutting-edge computational tools and address social concerns.",ISBN_13: 9780262367592; ISBN_10: 0262367599,True,True,201,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyMuEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyMuEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2146.42,INR,2146.42,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jyMuEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jyMuEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022,MIT Press

We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives - where we go to school, whether we get a loan, how much we pay for insurance - are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. And yet, as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and incontestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination. Tracing the arc of a person's life, O'Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These ""weapons of math destruction"" score teachers and students, sort CVs, grant or deny loans, evaluate workers, target voters, and monitor our health. O'Neil calls on modellers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it's up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives.

GR2jzgEACAAJ,datascience,Introduction to Probability for Data Science,N/A,Stanley H. Chan,"""Probability is one of the most interesting subjects in electrical engineering and computer science. It bridges our favorite engineering principles to the practical reality, a world that is full of uncertainty. However, because probability is such a mature subject, the undergraduate textbooks alone might fill several rows of shelves in a library. When the literature is so rich, the challenge becomes how one can pierce through to the insight while diving into the details. For example, many of you have used a normal random variable before, but have you ever wondered where the 'bell shape' comes from? Every probability class will teach you about flipping a coin, but how can 'flipping a coin' ever be useful in machine learning today? Data scientists use the Poisson random variables to model the internet traffic, but where does the gorgeous Poisson equation come from?

Tech innovator Jeff Hawkins reshaped our relationship to computers with devices like the PalmPilot. Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself. In this book, Hawkins develops a powerful theory of human cognition and explains how, based on his theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. According to Hawkins, the brain is a complex system that remembers sequences of events and their nested relationships. This style of organization reflects the true structure of the world and allows us to make increasingly accurate predictions. This memory-prediction process in turn forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style accessible to the general reader, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of brain function can be applied to building intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.

The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.

rMKiCgAAQBAJ,datascience,Bayesian Methods for Hackers,Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference,Cameron Davidson-Pilon,"Master Bayesian Inference through Practical Examples and Computation–Without Advanced Mathematical Analysis Bayesian methods of inference are deeply natural and extremely powerful. However, most discussions of Bayesian inference rely on intensely complex mathematical analyses and artificial examples, making it inaccessible to anyone without a strong mathematical background. Now, though, Cameron Davidson-Pilon introduces Bayesian inference from a computational perspective, bridging theory to practice–freeing you to get results using computing power. Bayesian Methods for Hackers illuminates Bayesian inference through probabilistic programming with the powerful PyMC language and the closely related Python tools NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Using this approach, you can reach effective solutions in small increments, without extensive mathematical intervention. Davidson-Pilon begins by introducing the concepts underlying Bayesian inference, comparing it with other techniques and guiding you through building and training your first Bayesian model. Next, he introduces PyMC through a series of detailed examples and intuitive explanations that have been refined after extensive user feedback. You’ll learn how to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, choose appropriate sample sizes and priors, work with loss functions, and apply Bayesian inference in domains ranging from finance to marketing. Once you’ve mastered these techniques, you’ll constantly turn to this guide for the working PyMC code you need to jumpstart future projects. Coverage includes • Learning the Bayesian “state of mind” and its practical implications • Understanding how computers perform Bayesian inference • Using the PyMC Python library to program Bayesian analyses • Building and debugging models with PyMC • Testing your model’s “goodness of fit” • Opening the “black box” of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to see how and why it works • Leveraging the power of the “Law of Large Numbers” • Mastering key concepts, such as clustering, convergence, autocorrelation, and thinning • Using loss functions to measure an estimate’s weaknesses based on your goals and desired outcomes • Selecting appropriate priors and understanding how their influence changes with dataset size • Overcoming the “exploration versus exploitation” dilemma: deciding when “pretty good” is good enough • Using Bayesian inference to improve A/B testing • Solving data science problems when only small amounts of data are available Cameron Davidson-Pilon has worked in many areas of applied mathematics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes and diseases to stochastic modeling of financial prices. His contributions to the open source community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python.

syCYEAAAQBAJ,datascience,Data Science with Semantic Technologies,"Theory, Practice and Application","Archana Patel, Narayan C. Debnath, Bharat Bhusan","DATA SCIENCE WITH SEMANTIC TECHNOLOGIES This book will serve as an important guide toward applications of data science with semantic technologies for the upcoming generation and thus becomes a unique resource for scholars, researchers, professionals, and practitioners in this field. To create intelligence in data science, it becomes necessary to utilize semantic technologies which allow machine-readable representation of data. This intelligence uniquely identifies and connects data with common business terms, and it also enables users to communicate with data. Instead of structuring the data, semantic technologies help users to understand the meaning of the data by using the concepts of semantics, ontology, OWL, linked data, and knowledge-graphs. These technologies help organizations to understand all the stored data, adding the value in it, and enabling insights that were not available before. As data is the most important asset for any organization, it is essential to apply semantic technologies in data science to fulfill the need of any organization. Data Science with Semantic Technologies provides a roadmap for the deployment of semantic technologies in the field of data science. Moreover, it highlights how data science enables the user to create intelligence through these technologies by exploring the opportunities and eradicating the challenges in the current and future time frame. In addition, this book provides answers to various questions like: Can semantic technologies be able to facilitate data science? Which type of data science problems can be tackled by semantic technologies? How can data scientists benefit from these technologies? What is knowledge data science? How does knowledge data science relate to other domains? What is the role of semantic technologies in data science? What is the current progress and future of data science with semantic technologies? Which types of problems require the immediate attention of researchers? Audience Researchers in the fields of data science, semantic technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and other related domains, as well as industry professionals, software engineers/scientists, and project managers who are developing the software for data science.

uOmaDwAAQBAJ,datascience,Big Data Science and Analytics for Smart Sustainable Urbanism,Unprecedented Paradigmatic Shifts and Practical Advancements,Simon Elias Bibri,"We are living at the dawn of what has been termed ‘the fourth paradigm of science,’ a scientific revolution that is marked by both the emergence of big data science and analytics, and by the increasing adoption of the underlying technologies in scientific and scholarly research practices. Everything about science development or knowledge production is fundamentally changing thanks to the ever-increasing deluge of data. This is the primary fuel of the new age, which powerful computational processes or analytics algorithms are using to generate valuable knowledge for enhanced decision-making, and deep insights pertaining to a wide variety of practical uses and applications. This book addresses the complex interplay of the scientific, technological, and social dimensions of the city, and what it entails in terms of the systemic implications for smart sustainable urbanism. In concrete terms, it explores the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of smart sustainable urbanism and the unprecedented paradigmatic shifts and practical advances it is undergoing in light of big data science and analytics. This new era of science and technology embodies an unprecedentedly transformative and constitutive power—manifested not only in the form of revolutionizing science and transforming knowledge, but also in advancing social practices, producing new discourses, catalyzing major shifts, and fostering societal transitions. Of particular relevance, it is instigating a massive change in the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are studied and understood, and in how they are planned, designed, operated, managed, and governed in the face of urbanization. This relates to what has been dubbed data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, an emerging approach based on a computational understanding of city systems and processes that reduces urban life to logical and algorithmic rules and procedures, while also harnessing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view or synoptic intelligence of the city. This is increasingly being directed towards improving, advancing, and maintaining the contribution of both sustainable cities and smart cities to the goals of sustainable development. This timely and multifaceted book is aimed at a broad readership. As such, it will appeal to urban scientists, data scientists, urbanists, planners, engineers, designers, policymakers, philosophers of science, and futurists, as well as all readers interested in an overview of the pivotal role of big data science and analytics in advancing every academic discipline and social practice concerned with data–intensive science and its application, particularly in relation to sustainability.",ISBN_13: 9783030173128; ISBN_10: 3030173127,True,True,354,Political Science,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uOmaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uOmaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,21004.0,INR,21004.0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uOmaDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uOmaDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019,Springer

lpwIEQAAQBAJ,datascience,Secure Data Science,Integrating Cyber Security and Data Science,"Bhavani Thuraisingham, Murat Kantarcioglu, Latifur Khan","Secure data science, which integrates cyber security and data science, is becoming one of the critical areas in both cyber security and data science. This is because the novel data science techniques being developed have applications in solving such cyber security problems as intrusion detection, malware analysis, and insider threat detection. However, the data science techniques being applied not only for cyber security but also for every application area—including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and marketing—could be attacked by malware. Furthermore, due to the power of data science, it is now possible to infer highly private and sensitive information from public data, which could result in the violation of individual privacy. This is the first such book that provides a comprehensive overview of integrating both cyber security and data science and discusses both theory and practice in secure data science. After an overview of security and privacy for big data services as well as cloud computing, this book describes applications of data science for cyber security applications. It also discusses such applications of data science as malware analysis and insider threat detection. Then this book addresses trends in adversarial machine learning and provides solutions to the attacks on the data science techniques. In particular, it discusses some emerging trends in carrying out trustworthy analytics so that the analytics techniques can be secured against malicious attacks. Then it focuses on the privacy threats due to the collection of massive amounts of data and potential solutions. Following a discussion on the integration of services computing, including cloud-based services for secure data science, it looks at applications of secure data science to information sharing and social media.

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future.

Analyzing events with simple examples like comparing bandwidth, throughput, jitter, and optimizing server resource usage can be exhausting when applied to dozens or hundreds of devices. For instance, how do we classify when the bandwidth is low in one place but normal elsewhere based on several sample events? Or how do we classify which servers need maintenance and which do not, based on existing data parameters, referring to unsupervised and supervised learning? Classification models can indeed simplify and optimize our work, saving time compared to performing network maintenance one by one, using only Google Colab. In this context, we have tried using a small of unsupervised and supervised learning to process data from simple network case studies. These data are analyzed for classification, regression, and prediction using Python scripts implemented in Google Colab.

Written to be an entertaining read, this invaluable guide investigates the all too common mistakes of data scientists - who can be plagued by lazy thinking, whims, hunches, and prejudices - and indicates how they have been at the root of many disasters, including the Great Recession. Gary Smith and Jay Cordes emphasise how scientific rigor and critical thinking skills are indispensable in this age of Big Data, as machines often find meaningless patterns that can lead to dangerous false conclusions.

The People Vs Tech makes clear that there is still time – just – for us to take back control’ - Camilla Cavendish, Sunday Times The internet was meant to set us free. Tech has radically changed the way we live our lives. But have we unwittingly handed too much away to shadowy powers behind a wall of code, all manipulated by a handful of Silicon Valley utopians, ad men, and venture capitalists? And, in light of recent data breach scandals around companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, what does that mean for democracy, our delicately balanced system of government that was created long before big data, total information and artificial intelligence? In this urgent polemic, Jamie Bartlett argues that through our unquestioning embrace of big tech, the building blocks of democracy are slowly being removed. The middle class is being eroded, sovereign authority and civil society is weakened, and we citizens are losing our critical faculties, maybe even our free will. The People Vs Tech is an enthralling account of how our fragile political system is being threatened by the digital revolution. Bartlett explains that by upholding six key pillars of democracy, we can save it before it is too late. We need to become active citizens; uphold a shared democratic culture; protect free elections; promote equality; safeguard competitive and civic freedoms; and trust in a sovereign authority. This essential book shows that the stakes couldn’t be higher and that, unless we radically alter our course, democracy will join feudalism, supreme monarchies and communism as just another political experiment that quietly disappeared.",ISBN_13: 9781473559127; ISBN_10: 147355912X,True,False,181,Technology & Engineering,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lQI_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lQI_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,441.61,INR,309.13,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lQI_DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-lQI_DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2018,Random House

Niranjanamurthy","DATA ENGINEERING and DATA SCIENCE Written and edited by one of the most prolific and well-known experts in the field and his team, this exciting new volume is the “one-stop shop” for the concepts and applications of data science and engineering for data scientists across many industries. The field of data science is incredibly broad, encompassing everything from cleaning data to deploying predictive models. However, it is rare for any single data scientist to be working across the spectrum day to day. Data scientists usually focus on a few areas and are complemented by a team of other scientists and analysts. Data engineering is also a broad field, but any individual data engineer doesn’t need to know the whole spectrum of skills. Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information. In this exciting new volume, the team of editors and contributors sketch the broad outlines of data engineering, then walk through more specific descriptions that illustrate specific data engineering roles. Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. This book brings together machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to integrate modeling and control of dynamical systems with modern methods in data science. It highlights many of the recent advances in scientific computing that enable data-driven methods to be applied to a diverse range of complex systems, such as turbulence, the brain, climate, epidemiology, finance, robotics, and autonomy. Whether for the veteran engineer or scientist working in the field or laboratory, or the student or academic, this is a must-have for any library.",ISBN_13: 9781119841876; ISBN_10: 1119841879,False,True,469,Mathematics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KxLUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KxLUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2023,John Wiley & Sons
NZP6AQAAQBAJ,datascience,Machine Learning,A Probabilistic Perspective,Kevin P. Murphy,"A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online.

AFyfAwAAQBAJ,datascience,Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis,N/A,"National Research Council, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications, Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, Committee on the Analysis of Massive Data","Data mining of massive data sets is transforming the way we think about crisis response, marketing, entertainment, cybersecurity and national intelligence. Collections of documents, images, videos, and networks are being thought of not merely as bit strings to be stored, indexed, and retrieved, but as potential sources of discovery and knowledge, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques that go far beyond classical indexing and keyword counting, aiming to find relational and semantic interpretations of the phenomena underlying the data. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis examines the frontier of analyzing massive amounts of data, whether in a static database or streaming through a system. Data at that scale-terabytes and petabytes-is increasingly common in science (e.g., particle physics, remote sensing, genomics), Internet commerce, business analytics, national security, communications, and elsewhere. The tools that work to infer knowledge from data at smaller scales do not necessarily work, or work well, at such massive scale. New tools, skills, and approaches are necessary, and this report identifies many of them, plus promising research directions to explore. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis discusses pitfalls in trying to infer knowledge from massive data, and it characterizes seven major classes of computation that are common in the analysis of massive data. Overall, this report illustrates the cross-disciplinary knowledge-from computer science, statistics, machine learning, and application disciplines-that must be brought to bear to make useful inferences from massive data.",ISBN_13: 9780309287814; ISBN_10: 0309287812,True,False,191,Mathematics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AFyfAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AFyfAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3741.24,INR,3741.24,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AFyfAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-AFyfAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013,National Academies Press

8nm0DQAAQBAJ,datascience,bookdown,Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown,Yihui Xie,"bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.",ISBN_13: 9781351792608; ISBN_10: 1351792601,False,True,140,Mathematics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8nm0DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8nm0DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2240.82,INR,2240.82,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8nm0DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-8nm0DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,CRC Press

Ray,"This second edition of the bestselling Learning XML provides web developers with a concise but grounded understanding of XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and its potential-- not just a whirlwind tour of XML.The author explains the important and relevant XML technologies and their capabilities clearly and succinctly with plenty of real-life projects and useful examples. He outlines the elements of markup--demystifying concepts such as attributes, entities, and namespaces--and provides enough depth and examples to get started. Learning XML is a reliable source for anyone who needs to know XML, but doesn't want to waste time wading through hundreds of web sites or 800 pages of bloated text.For writers producing XML documents, this book clarifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format. Designers will learn what parts of XML are most helpful to their team and will get started on creating Document Type Definitions. For programmers, the book makes syntax and structures clear. Learning XML also discusses the stylesheets needed for viewing documents in the next generation of browsers, databases, and other devices.Learning XML illustrates the core XML concepts and language syntax, in addition to important related tools such as the CSS and XSL styling languages and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures.

yLU7CwAAQBAJ,datascience,Predictive Analytics,"The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die",Eric Siegel,"""Mesmerizing & fascinating..."" —The Seattle Post-Intelligencer ""The Freakonomics of big data."" —Stein Kretsinger, founding executive of Advertising.com Award-winning | Used by over 30 universities | Translated into 9 languages An introduction for everyone. In this rich, fascinating — surprisingly accessible — introduction, leading expert Eric Siegel reveals how predictive analytics (aka machine learning) works, and how it affects everyone every day. Rather than a “how to” for hands-on techies, the book serves lay readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest state-of-the-art techniques. Prediction is booming. It reinvents industries and runs the world. Companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities are seizing upon the power. These institutions predict whether you're going to click, buy, lie, or die. Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats risk, boosts sales, fortifies healthcare, streamlines manufacturing, conquers spam, optimizes social networks, toughens crime fighting, and wins elections. How? Prediction is powered by the world's most potent, flourishing unnatural resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn. Predictive analytics (aka machine learning) unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future drives millions of decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. In this lucid, captivating introduction — now in its Revised and Updated edition — former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction: What type of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession. Predicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription, or get divorced before they even know it themselves. Why early retirement predicts a shorter life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights. Five reasons why organizations predict death — including one health insurance company. How U.S. Bank and Obama for America calculated the way to most strongly persuade each individual. Why the NSA wants all your data: machine learning supercomputers to fight terrorism. How IBM's Watson computer used predictive modeling to answer questions and beat the human champs on TV's Jeopardy! How companies ascertain untold, private truths — how Target figures out you're pregnant and Hewlett-Packard deduces you're about to quit your job. How judges and parole boards rely on crime-predicting computers to decide how long convicts remain in prison. 182 examples from Airbnb, the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, the IRS, LinkedIn, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, PayPal, Pfizer, Spotify, Uber, UPS, Wikipedia, and more. How does predictive analytics work? This jam-packed book satisfies by demystifying the intriguing science under the hood. For future hands-on practitioners pursuing a career in the field, it sets a strong foundation, delivers the prerequisite knowledge, and whets your appetite for more. A truly omnipresent science, predictive analytics constantly affects our daily lives. Whether you are a consumer of it — or consumed by it — get a handle on the power of Predictive Analytics.",ISBN_13: 9781119145684; ISBN_10: 1119145686,False,True,368,Business & Economics,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yLU7CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yLU7CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,824.82,INR,412.41,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yLU7CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-yLU7CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016,John Wiley & Sons

We can do things with computers that could never be done before, and computers can do things for us that could never be done before. But our love of computers should not cloud our thinking about their limitations. We are told that computers are smarter than humans and that data mining can identify previously unknown truths, or make discoveries that will revolutionize our lives. Our lives may well be changed, but not necessarily for the better. Computers are very good at discovering patterns, but are useless in judging whether the unearthed patterns are sensible because computers do not think the way humans think. We fear that super-intelligent machines will decide to protect themselves by enslaving or eliminating humans. But the real danger is not that computers are smarter than us, but that we think computers are smarter than us and, so, trust computers to make important decisions for us. The AI Delusion explains why we should not be intimidated into thinking that computers are infallible, that data-mining is knowledge discovery, and that black boxes should be trusted.",ISBN_13: 9780192557803; ISBN_10: 0192557807,True,True,330,Computers,en,smallThumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2h5pDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api; thumbnail: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2h5pDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,FOR_SALE,True,436.86,INR,305.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2h5pDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2h5pDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2018,Oxford University Press
8_rzBgAAQBAJ,datascience,Machine Learning in Python,Essential Techniques for Predictive Analysis,Michael Bowles,"Learn a simpler and more effective way to analyze data and predict outcomes with Python Machine Learning in Python shows you how to successfully analyze data using only two core machine learning algorithms, and how to apply them using Python. By focusing on two algorithm families that effectively predict outcomes, this book is able to provide full descriptions of the mechanisms at work, and the examples that illustrate the machinery with specific, hackable code. The algorithms are explained in simple terms with no complex math and applied using Python, with guidance on algorithm selection, data preparation, and using the trained models in practice. You will learn a core set of Python programming techniques, various methods of building predictive models, and how to measure the performance of each model to ensure that the right one is used. The chapters on penalized linear regression and ensemble methods dive deep into each of the algorithms, and you can use the sample code in the book to develop your own data analysis solutions. Machine learning algorithms are at the core of data analytics and visualization. In the past, these methods required a deep background in math and statistics, often in combination with the specialized R programming language. This book demonstrates how machine learning can be implemented using the more widely used and accessible Python programming language. Predict outcomes using linear and ensemble algorithm families Build predictive models that solve a range of simple and complex problems Apply core machine learning algorithms using Python Use sample code directly to build custom solutions Machine learning doesn't have to be complex and highly specialized.
