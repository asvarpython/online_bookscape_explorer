## Project Overview üöÄ

This project includes several key components for processing and visualizing book data:

### Data Acquisition üì•

The book data is sourced using the Google Books API. To use this application, you need to generate a separate API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

### Data Cleaning and Transformation üîß

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Numeric columns (e.g., `pageCount`, `ratingsCount`): Fill missing values with `0`.
  - Text columns (e.g., `book_description`, `categories`): Fill missing values with `"Not Available"`.
  - Boolean columns (e.g., `isEbook`, `text_readingModes`): Fill missing values with `False`.
- **Data Type Conversion**:
  - Convert `pageCount` to `INT`.
  - Convert `averageRating` to `DECIMAL`.
